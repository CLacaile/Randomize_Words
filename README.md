# Randomize_Words

Python script that gives a random word from a list input beforehand.
I use this script to train my knowledge before an oral exam.
Call the script without any options to print the random word

## Options:

  [-add word1 word2 ... wordN] : add word1 to wordN to the list;
  
  [-print] : print the list of words in the list;
  
  [-seed nb] : set the seed to the value nb (0 is default);
  
  [-clear] : empty the list of words.
